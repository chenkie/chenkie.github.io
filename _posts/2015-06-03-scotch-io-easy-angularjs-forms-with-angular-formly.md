Have you ever created a form in AngularJS and been frustrated with how bloated your HTML was? Putting lots of Angular attributes on our HTML tags can make things get big quickly and can lead to a mess of markup.

To get around this, I really like using angular-formly, a module that let’s us have just a couple lines of HTML and then define our form fields and their behaviour in JavaScript.

To show you how to use angular-formly, I’ve written an [article for Scotch.io](https://scotch.io/tutorials/easy-angularjs-forms-with-angular-formly) where we’ll build a quick car rental form and make use of a bunch of the formly’s features.
