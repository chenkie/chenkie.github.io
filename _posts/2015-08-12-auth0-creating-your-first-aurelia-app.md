[Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) is a client-side JavaScript framework that has been gaining a lot of popularity lately. One of the nice aspects of Aurelia is that it anticipates common application needs and provides simple conventions for accomplishing them.

In [this article](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/08/05/creating-your-first-aurelia-app-from-authentication-to-calling-an-api/) I wrote for Auth0, we explore how to setup a basic Aurelia app that calls a NodeJS API for authentication and data. This example will be useful if you’re looking to get started with your first Aurelia app.
